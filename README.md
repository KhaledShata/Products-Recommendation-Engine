## Overview
This project was developed under the Omdena Berlin Chapter in Germany. It involved creating a sophisticated Recommendation Engine for products based in Berlin. Over an intense 8-week period, our global team of over 100 members collaborated to bring this innovative solution to fruition.

## Project Journey
- **Web Scraping & Data Collection:** Sourced product data through comprehensive web scraping.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standardized the data to prepare for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Gained insights from the data to guide further model development.
- **Recommendation Model Development:** Built the engine using advanced text processing techniques.
- **Model Deployment:** Deployed the model to make it accessible for real-time user queries.

## How It Works
1. **Preprocessing Text:** Text data is optimized for analysis.
2. **Transforming Query:** User inputs are standardized to match data format.
3. **Calculating Cosine Similarity:** Determines product relevance by measuring similarity with the user query.
4. **Generating Recommendations:** Outputs a list of top product recommendations based on similarity scores.
